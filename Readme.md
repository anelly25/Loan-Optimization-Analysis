# 💼 Loan Optimization & Performance Analysis

This project analyzes and predicts the **profitability** and **default risk** of various loan types under different macroeconomic conditions using historical data.

We also optimize the **loan portfolio mix** to balance return and risk across multiple economic scenarios — visualized with Power BI.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand how inflation, GDP, and unemployment impact loan performance.
- Train models to predict loan profitability and default risk by sector.
- Simulate economic scenarios (like recession, stagflation, boom economy).
- Recommend optimal loan allocations that maximize profit while minimizing risk.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   From SQL Server:
   - `LoanPerformanceData` (core loan performance)
   - `MacroEconomicData` (macro indicators)
   - Sector-specific tables:  
     CILoanData, CRELoanData, MortgageLoanData, ConstructionLoanData, etc.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Merge all tables on `Date` and `LoanPerformanceID`
   - Forward-fill missing values
   - Create unified training dataset

3. **Modeling**
   - Predict Profitability: `RandomForestRegressor`
   - Predict Default Risk: `LogisticRegression` and `XGBoostClassifier`
   - Tune & evaluate performance

4. **Scenario Generation**
   - Define economic inputs (Inflation, GDP, Unemployment)
   - Feed into trained models to simulate profitability & risk by loan type

5. **Optimization**
   - Use linear programming to maximize profitability
   - Subject to constraints (e.g., overall default risk < 0.5)
   - Output: Optimal allocation per loan type per scenario

6. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Page 1: Model output across all scenarios
   - Page 2: Macro trend correlation with profitability/default
   - Page 3: Suggested loan mix per economic environment

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The database contains the following main tables:

- `LoanPerformanceData`
- `MacroEconomicData`
- `CILoanData`
- `CRELoanData`
- `ConstructionLoanData`
- `MortgageLoanData`
- `RetailLoanData`
- `ConsumerLoanData`
- `MALoanData`
- `RestructuringLoanData`

Each sector-specific table is linked by `LoanPerformanceID`.

A full schema with table definitions is in `databaseSchema.sql`.

## ✅ What I'd Improve Next

- 🔧 Build a **Streamlit dashboard** to test real-time what-if scenarios
- 🧮 Expand optimization with risk-weighted returns and regulatory limits
- 📈 Add deeper loan-level detail (credit score, term, LTV, etc.)
- 🧪 Perform Monte Carlo simulations for **stress-testing**
- 📡 Integrate live data from APIs (e.g. FRED, BLS, Census)
